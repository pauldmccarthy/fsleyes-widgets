"""The ``fsleyes_widgets`` package contains various custom :mod:`wx` widgets
and utilities used by FSLeyes.


Some of the controls in ``fsleyes_widgets`` are duplicates of controls which
are already available in ``wx`` or ``wx.lib.agw``. In these instances, I wrote
my own implementations to work around annoying, quirky, and/or downright buggy
behaviour in the existing controls.


This file is used to store the current ``fsleyes-widgets`` version.
