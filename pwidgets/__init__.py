# __init__.py - Custom wx widgets used by the props package.

# Author: Paul McCarthy <pauldmccarthy@gmail.com>

"""The ``pwidgets`` (short for *props widgets*) package contains various
custom :mod:`wx` widgets used by the :mod:`props` package.  None of the
widgets defined in this package have any dependency on ``props`` - they are
standalone controls which can be used in any application.


Some of the controls in ``pwidgets`` are duplicates of controls which are
already available in ``wx`` or ``wx.lib.agw``. In these instances, I wrote my
own implementations to work around annoying, quirky, and/or downright buggy
behaviour in the existing controls.
